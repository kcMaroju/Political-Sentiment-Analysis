Our project's objective is to extract opinions of the public from twitter and predict the political party or member whom the public is favouring or opposing, for the upcoming assembly elections (2019). This is done by classifying them (public figures/political parties) as positively favoured i.e., positive or negative favoured i.e., negative or neutrally favoured i.e., neutral.
